This app was designed from the minds of university students who wanted to know where vending machines were on campus.

It allows students to keep track of vending machines with an image that is constantly cross updated by its user base! Long forgotten are the days of walking to a vending machine only to find it empty or wandering aimlessly in hopes of a bag of cheetos!
